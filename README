This is Ruby 1.9.

You use rvm right?

	$ rvm use 1.9.2

	info: Using ruby 1.9.2 preview3

There's a Gemfile.

	$ bundle install
	...
	Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.

That'll be nice.

There's also a Rakefile

	$ rake features
	...
	41 scenarios (41 passed)
	153 steps (153 passed)
	0m3.818s

Well, when you find bugs, I can't claim that "it worked here." ;-)

	$ bin/tw-problem /dev/stdin
	Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7
	Output #1: 9
	Output #2: 5
	Output #3: 13
	Output #4: 22
	Output #5: NO SUCH ROUTE
	Output #6: 2
	Output #7: 3
	Output #8: 9
	Output #9: 9
	Output #10: 7

But I'm sure you have your own test files.
