= Design Considerations

== Welcome to Graph Algorithms, 101.

Problems 1-5 walk a graph. A "walk" function should be sufficient, taking a
list of destinations.

Problem 6 is finding cycles with a maximum of 3 edges. DFS constrained at a
maximum of three edges.

Problem 7 is DFS contrained at exactly 4 edges.

Problems 8-9 are shortest path. Dijkstra's algorithm.

Problem 10 is DFS constrained at distance of 30.

== Presumptions

Problem 10 explicitly includes retreaded paths. Thus, I presume memory isn't
necessary. Instead, I'll cap my depth.

Storing the graph idiomatically in Ruby. This means hash table lookups
everywhere making any complexity analysis quite bunk. But it also makes the
code easier to read.

Essentially, I'm handwaving on performance.
